# Redux

> There is great documentation on the [Redux site](http://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/index.html) and 
> I highly recommend watching Redux author Dan Abramov's [Getting Started with Redux](https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux) 
> and [Building React Applications with Idiomatic Redux](https://egghead.io/courses/building-react-applications-with-idiomatic-redux).

Redux is a state management library that is very simple and has three main principals. It is so simple the author
[Dan Abramov](https://github.com/gaearon) made a [98 line version](https://gist.github.com/gaearon/ffd88b0e4f00b22c3159) which is the bare
bones of the library (sans some edge case handling and comments).

It is made up of a number of concepts that at first can seem daunting but are actually quite simple. In short
when using Redux you store all your application state in one JavaScript object (the store). This state is read-only
and the only way to change it is to emit an `Action` via the `store.dispatch()` function. When an action is dispatched the current state and the action are passed
to what is called a 'reducer'. A reducer is a pure function (more on that later) that takes the current state and the action that has been dispatched and returns
the new state. 

The reducer does not mutate the state but instead creates a new state with the changes required. These changes then flow down to your
components.

## Three principals of Redux

There are three basic principals of Redux.

### 1 Single source of truth

> The state of your entire application is stored in an object tree with a single [Redux store](http://redux.js.org/docs/Glossary.html#store)

This makes it really easy to make universal apps that can render on the server as well as making it easier to debug
since every action in your application can be tracked and stepped through after the fact. For example this could be
the shape of my application state:

```
{
    employees:[]
}
```

I have an array `employees` to store my employee data and at this stage that makes up my entire application state.

### 2 State is read-only

The 'single source of truth' state is read only (i.e. immutable). This means that in order to change the state of the application
you have to create a new version of the state object with the changes required. This can be done in various ways
including using [immutable.js](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/) or with 
ES2015 [Object.assign()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign). 
For simplicities sake in this tutorial we are going to use `Object.assign()` although you might consider immutable.js for performance
reasons in a more complex application.

##### Actions

The only way that state can be mutated is through using the redux `store.dispatch()` function to 
dispatch an action. An action is just a plain JavaScript object that has a `type` property that describes the action along with any data required for the action. For
example imagine that the application has bootstrapped and we have a state that looks like this:

```
{
    employees:[]
}
```

At this point our component could dispatch an action called `REQUEST_EMPLOYEES` using the `store.dispatch()` method

```
store.dispatch({
  type: 'REQUEST_EMPLOYEES'
})
```

This would get passed to your reducer function.

##### Reducers

A [Reducer](http://redux.js.org/docs/Glossary.html#reducer) is a functions that take the previous state as the first argument 
and the action being dispatched as second argument. It then returns the *new* state like so:

``` javascript
const reducer = (state, action) => {
    return state
}
```

The above example is the simplest reducer where we just return the previous state. Now we need to add the logic to respond to the 
`REQEUST_EMPLOYEES` action.

### 3rd Principle -  State changes are made with pure functions

Pure functions are functions that do not have any observable side effects such as database calls, network calls or
shared session data. In our example we could do this:

> Note: for the sake of keeping this section simple we are assuming `getEmployees()` is a synchronous opperation. 

``` javascript
const reducer = (state, action) => {
    state.employees = getEmployees();
    return state;
}
```

This works and produces the correct state object but I have mutated the original state object and broken the rule of it being a pure function. This principal is necessary
to get some of the advantages of Redux such as the [Redux Dev Tools](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-devtools) I will show you later.

The better way to do this is to use Object.assign.

> Note: In larger more serious apps its better to use [immutable.js](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/) to boost performance and memory usable.

``` javascript
const reducer = (state, action) => {
    return Object.assign({}, state, {
        employees: getEmployees()
    });
}
```

Now the state will look like populated with an array for employee objects:

``` javascript
{
    employees: [{...},{...}],
}
```

So that is the three principals:

1. The entire state of your application is stored in on state object
2. The state is read-only. The only way to change it is to emit an action
3. Changes are made with pure functions.

Before we get into building this into our app I have a simple repository I have set up just for playing around with Redux concepts.
