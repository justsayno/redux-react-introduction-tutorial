## Redux React Introduction Tutorial

This tutorial is a part two in my series that started with [React Introduction Tutorial](https://github.com/justsayno/react-introduction-tutorial).
This covered the basics of React and React Router but didn't really go into how to manage user interactions and applications state. This tutorial
will cover the basics of Redux and how to use it with a React app.

To get the code for this tutorial and follow along clone the companion code repo for this tutorial [from here](https://github.com/justsayno/redux-react-introduction-code) and
follow the instructions to get started. This will let you follow along with my code changes by switching branches for each step.

I am going to show you how to build out the employee C.V. manager app I began in the first part but first we need to explain what Redux is, why you would use it
and how it works.

There is great documentation on the [Redux documentation site ](http://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/index.html)and I highly recommend watching Redux author Dan Abramov's 
[Getting Started with Redux](https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux) 
and [Building React Applications with Idiomatic Redux](https://egghead.io/courses/building-react-applications-with-idiomatic-redux).

Since Redux is so heavily based on Flux I thought I would explain what Flux is in the first.
